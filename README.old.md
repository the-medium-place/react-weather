This is a simple weather app built using the [Opeanweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/) and [React JS](https://reactjs.org/). I will be continuing to work on this app adding functionality and UI upgrades as a form of practice in building React apps. Feel free to contact me with ideas or issues.

## Usage

Visit the deployed app [HERE](https://zgs-react-weather.herokuapp.com/).

The main page will load with the current weather for your GPS location.

Click 'Search' to search by city for current conditions and the 5-day forecast.

Click '404 check' to see my test for a non-existent link. On second thought, don't click on that one.
